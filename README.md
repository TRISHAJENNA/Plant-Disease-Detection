Nowadays, numerous individuals utilize social media platforms to share tweets about
their daily lives, which often reflect their mental well-being. Recognizing and managing stress is
essential before it becomes a serious issue. Each day, a significant volume of informal messages
is posted on discussion forums, blogs, and social networking sites. This research presents an
approach to identify stress by leveraging data from social media platforms, particularly Twitter.
The project encompasses various tasks, including data collection, data cleaning, system training,
and stress identification for users. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine learning
methods like SVM, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour, Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Tree will be
used to do this. Detecting stress in a timely manner for preventive care is challenging. The
proposed study consists of two main components: stress detection through machine learning
methods and information extraction through natural language processing. The four primary
stages of this study involve text mining, auto summarization, stress detection, and collection of
social media data. The suggested model can predict an internet user's stress level or cognitive
load. It incorporates several machine learning strategies, with Support Vector Machine
demonstrating superior performance concerning F1 score, accuracy, recall, and precision
compared to other methods. The early detection of stress offered by the current methodology will
bring significant benefits to society. Therefore, the proposed system utilizes tweets as input to
make informed decisions.
